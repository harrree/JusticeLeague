    <h1 style="font-size:100px; font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif; background-color: black; color: brown;text-align: center;">Batman!</h1>
    <p style="border: 2px solid powderblue;text-align: justify;"><b><i>In the heart of Gotham, a city shrouded in shadows and despair, a lone figure emerges from the darkness. Batman, the Dark Knight, a symbol of fear for the wicked and a beacon of hope for the innocent. Clad in his iconic suit, he moves with a silent grace, a predator lurking in the urban jungle. His eyes, hidden behind the cowl, pierce through the darkness, seeking out injustice.
<q style="font-family: fantasy;font-size:40px;color: brown;">Batman</q> is not a super-powered hero, but a man driven by an unwavering commitment to justice. He is a master of martial arts, a brilliant detective, and a symbol of fear for those who prey on the weak. His methods may be questioned, his actions may be controversial, but his resolve is absolute. He is the protector of Gotham, the silent guardian, the Dark Knight who watches over the city, ensuring that justice prevails, even in the darkest of times.

  <p style="color: rgb(255, 0, 44);background-color: rgb(0, 8, 255);">High above the bustling metropolis of Metropolis, a streak of red and blue blazes across the sky.  Superman, the Last Son of Krypton, a beacon of hope and an embodiment of unwavering goodness, soars through the heavens.  He is more than just a hero; he is a symbol of what humanity can aspire to be.  His cape ripples in the wind, a vibrant flag against the backdrop of towering skyscrapers.  Beneath his calm exterior lies the power of a god, yet he carries this immense responsibility with a gentle heart and an unwavering commitment to truth and justice.  His eyes, pools of cerulean blue, reflect the boundless compassion he holds for the world he has sworn to protect.  He is the alien who chose to be human, the powerful being who chooses to be humble, the Superman who stands as a shining light against the darkness, a testament to the enduring power of hope.

  <p style="background-color: aquamarine;">From the mystical shores of Themyscira, a warrior emerges, a beacon of strength, compassion, and unwavering justice. Wonder Woman, Princess Diana, daughter of Hippolyta, strides into the world of man, not as a conqueror, but as an emissary of peace.  Clad in her Amazonian armor, gleaming under the harsh light of a world in turmoil, she embodies the power of her heritage.  Her tiara, a symbol of her royal lineage, rests upon her brow, framing a face both beautiful and fierce.  She wields not only the Lasso of Truth, compelling honesty from the deceitful, but also the strength of her convictions, a shield against the darkness that threatens to engulf humanity.  Her heart, filled with empathy for all, beats with the rhythm of a warrior's spirit, ready to defend the innocent and fight for a world where peace and understanding prevail.  She is Wonder Woman, an Amazonian princess in a world of men, a symbol of hope, a champion of justice, and a testament to the enduring power of love.
